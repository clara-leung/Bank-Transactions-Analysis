# Bank-Transactions-Analysis
**Data-driven customer segmentation and transaction insights for strategic banking decisions**

## Project Overview  
In a competitive banking environment, understanding customer behavior is critical for optimizing marketing efforts, enhancing product offerings, and improving customer loyalty. By analyzing transaction trends, spending patterns, and demographic characteristics, the bank can better anticipate customer needs, allocate resources effectively, and target interventions to maximize revenue and engagement. 

This project analyzes over 1 million bank transactions to uncover behavioral patterns, identify high-value customers, and provide actionable insights that drive business decisions for the bank. Through comprehensive analysis using Python, SQL, and Tableau, the goal is to combine data-driven understanding with strategic business perspectives to support customer engagement, retention, and growth.   

## Objectives  
- **Analyze Transaction Behavior:** Identify temporal trends, peak activity periods, and spending patterns to optimize promotions, system capacity, and operational planning.  
- **Customer Segmentation (RFM Analysis):** Segment customers based on Recency, Frequency, and Monetary metrics to distinguish high-value, loyal, and at-risk customers, enabling personalized engagement strategies.  
- **Location-Based Insights:** Explore regional differences in transaction volumes and spending behavior to inform targeted, geography-specific campaigns and resource allocation.  
- **Actionable Recommendations:** Translate analytical findings into concrete strategies that enhance retention, drive growth, and maximize customer lifetime value.
